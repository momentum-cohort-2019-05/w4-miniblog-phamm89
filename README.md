# Django Miniblog

For this assignment, go to [the MDN Django tutorial assessment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/django_assessment_blog) and follow the directions there to build a blog with Django. You **do not** have to create tests for this blog.

Remember these steps to set up your Django project:

* Make sure you are in this git repository in your terminal.
* Run `pipenv --three`
* Run `pipenv install django`
* Run `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment where you now have Django installed.
* To start your Django project, run `django-admin startproject <project_name> .` where <project_name> is replaced with your project name. Note the period after the project name. If you don't put that, another directory will be created, which you don't want.
